# Notebooks Directory

This directory is intended for additional Jupyter notebooks related to the **ApiPlaygroundPy** project.

Suggested usage:

- Create exploratory notebooks for new APIs you are testing.
- Prototype data processing pipelines using `src/data_processing.py`.
- Document examples or tutorials.

Keep notebooks small and focused when possible. Consider exporting key
examples to scripts or modules in `src/` once they stabilize.
